Some doesn't bother your\ncall and even loves to talk to you even if they're occupied with their things,\nand there're some who wouldn't mind calling you back as soon as you leave a\nmissed call.\n\nDeal with it bro. You're the one who failed in choosing the so called right\n'friends' and it is not your fault you don't have a friendship like the 6 had in\nF.R.I.E.N.D.S.\n\nAny Regrets? I would say NEVER coz even though everything seems out of place,\nWe're friends and will always be.\n\nn.b. this was purely about me and me only. I think I criticized myself.
