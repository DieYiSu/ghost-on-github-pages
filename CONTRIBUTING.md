You can report bugs, ask questions, and request features using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/abhijithvijayan/ghost-on-github-pages/issues).

**Before posting, please do a search to make sure your issue or question hasn't already been reported or discussed.** If no matching issue exists, go ahead and create one.

**Please be sure to include all of the following:**

1. A clear, descriptive title (ie. "A bug" is not a good title).
2. Screenshots
	- Clearly demonstrate the bug or issue.

Duplicates and issues without a reduced test case may be closed without comment.

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a good place to find solutions to most of the errors you might face.
